        <p>   <p>
            Deforestation affects the people and animals where trees are cut, as well as the wider world. Removing trees deprives the forest of portions of its canopy, which blocks the sunâ€™s rays during the day and retains heat at night. That disruption leads to more extreme temperature swings that can be harmful to plants and animals even our planet.
